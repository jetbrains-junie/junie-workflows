# Junie â€” AI Coding Agent now lives on GitHub ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Early Access Program** for Junie for GitHub.

Junie is a coding agent by JetBrains which redefines how you code. 
We designed it to work in close collaboration with a developer for routine and complex tasks, opening the new way to code in both IDEs and outside the IDE, on GitHub.

## âœ¨ What Can Junie Do?

### Create PRs from Issues:
Add `junie` word to your issue title and describe the task â€” Junie will generate a Pull Request.

### Fix via Comments:
Comment `@jetbrains-junie fix` on an issue â€” Junie will patch the code on and create Pull Request.

## âœ… How to Enable

1. Install the [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/jetbrains-junie), and weâ€™ll handle setup for you ðŸ’« 
Junie will automatically create a Pull Request with the workflow file and install itself in your repository.
Or manually add the following workflow file to `.github/workflows/ej-issue.yml`:

<details> <summary>Click to view the workflow file</summary>

```yaml
name: Junie
run-name: Junie run ${{ inputs.run_id }}

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  packages: read

on:
  workflow_dispatch:     
    inputs:
      run_id:
        description: "id of workflow process"
        required: true
      workflow_params:
        description: "stringified params"
        required: true

jobs:
  call-workflow-passing-data:
    uses: jetbrains-junie/junie-workflows/.github/workflows/ej-issue.yml@main
    with:
      workflow_params: ${{ inputs.workflow_params }}
```

</details>

2. It will also add a `devcontainer.json` file to help run Junie in a containerized environment.

3. Please review the `devcontainer.json` carefully and adjust it if needed â€” the better it fits your project, the better Junie will perform! ðŸ§
