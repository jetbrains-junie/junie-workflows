# Junie ‚Äî AI Coding Agent now lives on GitHub üöÄ

Welcome to the **Early Access Program** for Junie for GitHub.

Junie is a coding agent by JetBrains that redefines how you code.  
We designed it to work in close collaboration with developers ‚Äî handling routine and complex tasks both in your IDE and
right here, on GitHub.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Enable Junie

### Enable GitHub Actions

Before installing Junie, make sure GitHub Actions are enabled in your repository:
1. Go to your repository's **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Actions > General**
3. Select **Allow all actions and reusable workflows**
4. Click **Save**

### Install the GitHub App

Simply install the [Junie GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/jetbrains-junie) ‚Äî setup is automatic! üí´

### What Happens After Installation

Once installed, Junie will automatically:

- Create a Pull Request with the required workflow file (`.github/workflows/ej-issue.yml`)
- Add a `devcontainer.json` file to your repository to support containerized environments

> Junie is currently in closed Early Access.  
> To join, please visit our [Discord](https://jb.gg/junie/github) or ask to be added to the whitelist.

### [Dev Container configuration](https://github.com/jetbrains-junie/junie-workflows/blob/main/devcontainer-setup.md)

Junie runs in the environment set by your `devcontainer.json` file. This file must define an environment where your project can be built and tested successfully.

We provide a default devcontainer setup, but you might need to adjust it to suit your project's needs. [more information](https://github.com/jetbrains-junie/junie-workflows/blob/main/devcontainer-setup.md).

## üîê Providing Secrets to Junie

Junie can access secrets (like API keys) during execution through the `JUNIE_SECRETS_JSON` feature. This allows you to securely provide credentials that your code might need.

### How to Set Up Secrets

1. Go to your repository's **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Secrets and variables > Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Create a secret named `JUNIE_SECRETS_JSON`
5. Set the value as a JSON string containing your secrets:
   ```json
   {"OPENAI_KEY":"your-api-key-here","ANOTHER_KEY":"another-value"}
   ```

### How It Works

- The secrets from `JUNIE_SECRETS_JSON` become available as environment variables during Junie's execution
- For example, if you provide `{"OPENAI_KEY":"sk-123"}`, Junie can access it as the `OPENAI_KEY` environment variable
- All secret values are automatically masked in GitHub Actions logs for security

> **Note:** This feature is automatically available if you use the Junie GitHub App. For manual setups, make sure to include the secrets configuration in your workflow file.

### üìù Manual Setup (optional)

If needed, you can configure Junie manually by adding the following file to `.github/workflows/ej-issue.yml`:

<details>
<summary>Click to view the workflow file</summary>

```yaml
name: Junie
run-name: Junie run ${{ inputs.run_id }}

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  packages: read

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      run_id:
        description: "id of workflow process"
        required: true
      workflow_params:
        description: "stringified params"
        required: true

jobs:
  call-workflow-passing-data:
    uses: jetbrains-junie/junie-workflows/.github/workflows/ej-issue.yml@main
    with:
      workflow_params: ${{ inputs.workflow_params }}
    secrets:
      JUNIE_SECRETS_JSON: ${{ secrets.JUNIE_SECRETS_JSON }}
```

</details>

## How Junie Works

### Trigger Junie from Issues

1. Create an **Issue** with the word `junie` in the title.
2. Or add a **Comment** with `@jetbrains-junie` to an existing issue.

> _Note: File attachments are not yet supported. Please provide your request in plain text._

---

### Pull Requests with Junie

Junie helps you iterate on pull requests with smart suggestions:

- Comments with `@jetbrains-junie` are picked up and processed.
- If part of a **code review**, Junie waits until the review is submitted and picks up all comments with the mention
- If the PR was created by Junie or the author of comments with mentions, fixes are committed to the same branch,
  otherwise, Junie creates a **new PR** with the changes.
- Parallel runs on the same PR branch are prevented.

> _Note: Advanced configuration options (like custom keywords or target branches) are coming soon._
