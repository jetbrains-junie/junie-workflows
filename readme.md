# Junie ‚Äî AI Coding Agent now lives on GitHub üöÄ

Welcome to the **Early Access Program** for Junie for GitHub.

Junie is a coding agent by JetBrains that redefines how you code.  
We designed it to work in close collaboration with developers ‚Äî handling routine and complex tasks both in your IDE and
right here, on GitHub.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Enable Junie

### Install the GitHub App

Simply install the [Junie GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/jetbrains-junie) ‚Äî setup is automatic! üí´

### What Happens After Installation

Once installed, Junie will automatically:

- Create a Pull Request with the required workflow file (`.github/workflows/ej-issue.yml`)
- Add a `devcontainer.json` file to your repository to support containerized environments

You can review and adjust the `devcontainer.json` file if needed, but **no manual configuration is required** to get
started.

> Junie is currently in closed Early Access.  
> To join, please visit our [Discord](https://jb.gg/junie/github) or ask to be added to the whitelist.

### üìù Manual Setup (optional)

If needed, you can configure Junie manually by adding the following file to `.github/workflows/ej-issue.yml`:

<details>
<summary>Click to view the workflow file</summary>

```yaml
name: Junie
run-name: Junie run ${{ inputs.run_id }}

permissions:

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      run_id:
        description: "id of workflow process"
        required: true
      workflow_params:
        description: "stringified params"
        required: true

```

</details>

## How Junie Works

### Trigger Junie from Issues

1. Create an **Issue** with the word `junie` in the title.
2. Or add a **Comment** with `@jetbrains-junie` to an existing issue.

> _Note: File attachments are not yet supported. Please provide your request in plain text._

---

### Pull Requests with Junie

Junie helps you iterate on pull requests with smart suggestions:

- Comments with `@jetbrains-junie` are picked up and processed.
- If part of a **code review**, Junie waits until the review is submitted and picks up all comments with the mention
- If the PR was created by Junie or the author of comments with mentions, fixes are committed to the same branch,
  otherwise, Junie creates a **new PR** with the changes.
- Parallel runs on the same PR branch are prevented.

> _Note: Advanced configuration options (like custom keywords or target branches) are coming soon._
